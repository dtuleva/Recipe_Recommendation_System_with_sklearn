# Recipe_Recommendation_System_with_sklearn

### Exam Project for Data Science, June 2023 @ SoftUni

This work aims to create a content-based recommendation system for food recipes. Recipe related data is acquired, cleaned and processed and a model is trained and evaluated using pandas and sklearn; visualization utilizes matplotlib. Features on focus are recipe title, ingredients, cooking instructions, cooking times and user rating, our unsupervised clustering model does not account for recipe categories.
